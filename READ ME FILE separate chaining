Separate Chaining

Review #1
Separate chaining uses arrays and linked list which are linked to different locations of different values within a hash table. 
It is very useful because collisions rarely occur within separate chaining and there is no size to the table and no load factor because you cannot fill it up ever. 
My code uses separate chaining to search for words within a file and give the amount of words, the amount of collisions. 
It also tells you the amount of time it should take to search for a word and the amount of probes that are used for that word. 
  The code should run smoothly and give a clear output. 

Review #2

In my second week of working on my project I have been able to output the time taken to search and the number of probes used for 1,10,20,30,40, and 50 words that we as a group have chosen. 
I have also made a chart with the position of each word and the number of times each of those positions has been hashed to. 
I have tweaked my code to make it output everything I need for success. My graph was pretty consistent with the values, 
the only thing I noticed was the when the positions got larger, the frequencies tended to be larger, while the positions were smaller, 
the frequencies tend to be smaller or even zero.

Review #3

In this part I filled in the tables for the number of probes used and the amount of times a certain position is hashed to. For each of these I created graphs
to show my data. After that I took time taken to search 10,20,30,40,and 50 words and made graphs for each of them to comaopre the times between each idea. After putting together
my project report with everyones informnation in one document.
